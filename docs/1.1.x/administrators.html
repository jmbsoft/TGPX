<b class="heading">Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

The TGPX control panel allows you to configure multiple administrator accounts so you can have several people working with the data at once.  This document will provide an
overview of the administrator account features of TGPX

<br />
<br />

<b class="heading">Account Types</b>

<br />
<br />

There are two different types of administrator accounts: Editors and Administrators.  Administrator level accounts will have access to all of the functions in the TGPX control panel,
and therefore should be reserved for those people that you completely trust.  These users will be able to edit the software settings, templates, gallery data, category data, and use all of
the other functions in the control panel.

<br />
<br />

The other type of account is an Editor account which will allow access to the gallery, category, and partner functions based on the privileges you select.  So, for example, if
you want to allow someone to access your TGPX control panel so they can approve new galleries, but not edit the templates, you would create an Editor level account for them.

<br />
<br />

<b class="heading">Searching Accounts<a name="search"></a></b>

<br />
<br />

To view the currently configured administrator accounts so you can modify or delete them, access the Settings &gt; Manage Administrators function from the control panel menu.  This will display a 
page where you will be able to see all of the currently configured administrator accounts, and search them if necessary.

<br />
<br />

In the table that displays the administrator accounts, you will find several functions that you can run on a single administrator account.  Each of those functions are described below.

<ul>
<table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4" class="fields">
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right">
<img src="../images/edit.png" border="0" alt="">
</td>
<td>
Click this icon to edit the administrator account.  A window will appear where you will be able to edit all of the account settings.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right">
<img src="../images/mail.png" border="0" alt="">
</td>
<td>
Click this icon to send an e-mail to this administrator account.  A window will appear where you will enter the e-mail text.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right">
<img src="../images/trash.png" border="0" alt="">
</td>
<td>
Click this icon to delete this administrator account.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</ul>

In addition to running these functions on single accounts, there are also two functions you can run on multiple accounts at once.  To run these functions, put a check in the checkbox next to the
administrator accounts you want to run the function on, then press one of the two buttons at the bottom of the page.  The Delete button will delete the selected accounts; the E-mail button will display
a popup window where you will be able to enter the text of an e-mail message and send it to the selected accounts.

window where you will be able to enter the account information that you want to use.  Each of the form fields are described below.
